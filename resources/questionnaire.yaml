              explanation: 'Legal and licensing requirements must be assessed to determine their possible impact (cost, fault reporting) on the container platform hosting the application. Examples of legal requirements: isolated clusters, certifications, compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Examples of licensing requirements: per server, per CPU.'
